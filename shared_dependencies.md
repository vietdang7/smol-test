The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files. It is used to create components and manage the application's state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the files for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in `_document.tsx` and `_app.tsx` for rendering the application on the client side.

5. **CSS**: The `globals.css` file is used across the application for styling the components.

6. **Public assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the public directory are used across the application for displaying the favicon and the Vercel logo.

7. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is shared across all the files as it determines the packages that are installed and used in the application.

8. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is shared across all the files as it determines how TypeScript is compiled and checked.

9. **Index.tsx**: This is the main entry point of the application. It is used by `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx` for rendering the application.

10. **_app.tsx**: This file is used for initializing pages. It is used by `index.tsx` and `_document.tsx` for rendering the application.

11. **_document.tsx**: This file is used for customizing the HTML document. It is used by `index.tsx` and `_app.tsx` for rendering the application.
